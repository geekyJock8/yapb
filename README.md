</h1>

<img alt="screesnhot" src="./screenshot.png">

**YAPB: Yet Another Portfolio Blog** is an opinionated minimalistic portfolio and blog. It's built on top of [gatsby-personal-starter-blog](https://github.com/thomaswang/gatsby-personal-starter-blog). As a result it comes with Netlify CMS integration. The blog can be customised according to your needs. 

*So, go ahead and build your portfolio and write a world changing post.*

## üöÄ Quick start
1. **Install Gatsby**
    
    For more instruction checkout Gatsby official [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/).
    ```sh
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
1.  **Create a Gatsby site**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```sh
    gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/geekyJock8/yapb
    ```

1.  **Start developing**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Your site is live!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and start editing!
